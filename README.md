# Verizon Customer Default Prediction

### Overview
Verizon sells phones on a contract basis, and customer defaults result in financial losses. This project develops a predictive model to assess default risk and optimize acceptance policies.

### Model Selection
We evaluated three models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—based on key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, default rate, and financial impact. 

Among them, Random Forest demonstrated the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 91.6% and a precision of 66.2%, while minimizing the default rate to 5.58%. 

This resulted in the highest profitability, generating an estimated $162.1M in profit per million customers by effectively reducing losses from customer defaults.

### Business Impact
- Higher profit: +$58.2M net financial gain (56% increase).
- Lower default losses: -$66.7M by better customer selection.
- Safer revenue strategy: More selective acceptance improves financial stability.

### Key Recommendations
- Stricter Monitoring: Assess age and credit history for contract terms.
- Higher Down Payments: Reduce default risk but set a reasonable threshold.
- Proactive Engagement: Contact high-risk customers for financing options.
- Age-Specific Terms: Additional down payments or guardian signatures for younger users.
- Credit-Based Risk Mitigation: Charge premiums or conduct background checks for low-score customers.
